### Running Locally

#### Using Docker

Run PondPilot with a single command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4173:80 --name pondpilot ghcr.io/pondpilot/pondpilot:latest
```

Visit `http://localhost:4173` in your browser to access the app.

> **Note:** PWA and offline mode is disabled for the Docker version to avoid conflicts with other apps serving on localhost.

##### Subdirectory Deployment

PondPilot supports deployment in subdirectories alongside other services. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions on:

- Building with custom base paths (e.g., `/custompath/`, `/pondpilot/`)
- Configuring nginx reverse proxy
- Docker Compose examples

#### Using Yarn

Alternatively, you can build & run PondPilot using Yarn:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pondpilot/pondpilot.git
cd pondpilot

# Setup the project
corepack enable
yarn

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the app.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/⌘ + K`: Open spotlight menu to navigate, add files, create new queries and explore shortcuts
- `Ctrl + F`: Add file to analyze
- `Ctrl + D`: Add DuckDB file

## 🚀 Roadmap

The goal for PondPilot is to remain lightweight. We strive to quickly reach feature completeness and then accept only security fixes or updates to keep up with DuckDB.

Here is what we are planning before reaching feature completeness:

- Basic statistics & metadata view without the need to run queries (think data distribution, column types, etc.)
- Additional popular local & remote sources support: SQLite, MotherDuck
