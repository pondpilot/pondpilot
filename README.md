PondPilot is a blazing-fast, lightweight, 100% client-side data exploration tool that helps you analyze local & remote data with no setup. Powered by DuckDB-Wasm, it runs entirely in your browser - no install, no servers, no cloud uploads, complete privacy.

## üîç Features

- **Cross-session persistence**: All data-handles and queries are automatically saved and restored between sessions
- **Powered by DuckDB**: Leverage the powerful SQL engine for fast analysis of large datasets
- **Multiple File Formats**: Support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, DuckDB database and more coming soon
- **Interactive SQL Editor**: Write and execute SQL queries with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
- **Data Visualization**: View, filter, and sort your query results in an interactive table

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using the Web App

The easiest way to use PondPilot is through the hosted web app:

1. Visit [https://app.pondpilot.io](https://app.pondpilot.io)
2. Click "Add file" or use keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+F) to load your data
3. Start exploring!

### Browser Requirements

As of today PondPilot only guranteed to work best in Chrome due to the use of File System Access APIs not available in other browsers. Hopefully this will change in the future.

### Running Locally

#### Using Docker

Run PondPilot with a single command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4173:80 --name pondpilot ghcr.io/pondpilot/pondpilot:latest
```

Visit `http://localhost:4173` in your browser to access the app.

#### Using Yarn

Alternatively, you can build & run PondPilot using Yarn:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pondpilot/pondpilot.git
cd pondpilot

# Setup the project
corepack enable
yarn

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the app.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/‚åò + K`: Open spotlight menu to navigate, add files, create new queries and explore shortcuts
- In editor:
  - `Ctrl/‚åò + Enter`: Run the entire script
  - `Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + Enter`: Run the query under the cursor
- `Ctrl + F`: Add file to analyze
- `Ctrl + D`: Add DuckDB file
- `Ctrl + I`: Import SQL files

## üöÄ Roadmap

The goal for PondPilot is to remain lightweight. We strive to quickly reach feature completeness and then accept only security fixes or updates to keep up with DuckDB.

Here is what we are planning before reaching feature completeness:
* LLM-based code suggestions
* Basic statistics & metadata view without the need to run queries (think data distribution, column types, etc.)
* Additional popular local & remote sources support: XLSX, SQLite, MotherDuck

The official [hosted version](https://app.pondpilot.io/) of PondPilot and the latest tag for our [Docker image](https://ghcr.io/pondpilot/pondpilot) are continuously updated based on the `main` branch. However, we occasionally tag releases to mark significant milestones. You can read the draft release notes for the upcoming tagged version and all released versions on the [release page](https://github.com/pondpilot/pondpilot/releases) or in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
