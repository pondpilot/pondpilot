## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-13

A quick reminder: PondPilot is continuously updated at [app.pondpilot.io](https://app.pondpilot.io), but we occasionally mark major milestones so you can easily discover new features and improvements.

### ‚ú® Highlights

There have been many improvements since 0.1.0, including a complete rework of how we handle data sources, allowing us to open multi-gigabyte files in milliseconds. Here are some highlights:

- **Improved Performance**: PondPilot is now nearly as fast as the native DuckDB CLI and can open multi-gigabyte files instantly.
- **Script Sharing**: You can now share your scripts with others via a simple URL, making it easy to collaborate with your team or share your work with the community.
- **Automatic Data Refresh on External Changes**: If a local file source is changed outside of PondPilot, the app will now behave like a true desktop application and transparently pick up the changes. *Note: There are still some limitations with this feature, but we are working on it.*
- **Folder Support**: You can now add entire folders to PondPilot, and it will automatically include all the files inside.
- **Full Support for Multi-Tab State**: The app now feels like a true IDE, with tabs remembering their state between reloads and when switching.
- **Query Editor Improvements**: The query editor now provides better auto-completion suggestions, including automatic quoting. Finally, you can safely and easily work with your favorite file called `my ü¶Ü.csv`!

### üéØ What's Next

We are working on a new version. Here are some features you can expect:

- **Query Editor Improvements**: We know the current query editor is far from perfect; we are working on bringing a full VS Code experience to PondPilot.
- **Persistent Database**: Soon, PondPilot will persist the managed internal DuckDB database across reloads, so you'll be able to maintain not just scripts and sources, but also temporary tables and other DuckDB objects.
- **New Export Formats**: More export formats are coming, including JSON, Parquet, and DuckDB.
- **New (Remote) Data Sources**: Multiple new data sources are coming, including remote DuckDB databases.
