## ‚ú® Highlights

This release brings significant improvements to the SQL editing experience and data source management that make PondPilot more powerful and user-friendly:

- **üé® SQL Formatter with Editor Customization**: Transform your SQL editing experience with comprehensive formatting capabilities, including keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F), customizable font sizes, font weights, and auto-format options. The new formatting system uses DuckDB dialect support to ensure your queries look clean and professional.

## üéØ What's Next

We're continuing to enhance the core editing and data management experience:

- Additional SQL editor improvements and code intelligence features
- Extended data source support for more database types
- Enhanced export capabilities with multiple file formats
- Further UI refinements based on user feedback

## ‚ú® Highlights

Today's release brings major productivity improvements that make working with your data more intuitive and efficient:

- **@-mentions for Smart Context**: You can now mention datasets, queries, and scripts directly in your AI prompts by typing followed by the object name. The AI assistant gets full context about the objects you're referencing, leading to more accurate SQL suggestions and better error fixes.
- **Unified Explorer Experience**: We've completely redesigned the file and database explorers into a single, cohesive accordion-style interface. Now you can see databases within folders and navigate file systems and database schemas seamlessly in one place.

But that's not all! We've also enhanced autocomplete with Tab key support, improved the dark theme with better component consistency, streamlined export options, and fixed several important stability issues including schema synchronization and connection pool management.

We hope you'll enjoy these productivity-focused improvements! As always, we are looking forward to your feedback and suggestions.

- **Persistent Database**: Now you can create temporary tables, views, and other DuckDB objects that will persist across reloads.

But that's not all! We've also added support for more export formats, added schema browser, enabled file drag and drop, and upgraded DuckDB which unlocked the ability to attach remote DuckDB databases!

**Full Changelog**: [v0.2.0...v0.3.0](https://github.com/pondpilot/pondpilot/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-13

A quick reminder: PondPilot is continuously updated at [app.pondpilot.io](https://app.pondpilot.io), but we occasionally mark major milestones so you can easily discover new features and improvements.

### ‚ú® Highlights

There have been many improvements since 0.1.0, including a complete rework of how we handle data sources, allowing us to open multi-gigabyte files in milliseconds. Here are some highlights:

- **Improved Performance**: PondPilot is now nearly as fast as the native DuckDB CLI and can open multi-gigabyte files instantly.
- **Script Sharing**: You can now share your scripts with others via a simple URL, making it easy to collaborate with your team or share your work with the community.
- **Automatic Data Refresh on External Changes**: If a local file source is changed outside of PondPilot, the app will now behave like a true desktop application and transparently pick up the changes. _Note: There are still some limitations with this feature, but we are working on it._
- **Folder Support**: You can now add entire folders to PondPilot, and it will automatically include all the files inside.
- **Full Support for Multi-Tab State**: The app now feels like a true IDE, with tabs remembering their state between reloads and when switching.
- **Query Editor Improvements**: The query editor now provides better auto-completion suggestions, including automatic quoting. Finally, you can safely and easily work with your favorite file called `my ü¶Ü.csv`!

### üéØ What's Next

We are working on a new version. Here are some features you can expect:

- **Query Editor Improvements**: We know the current query editor is far from perfect; we are working on bringing a full VS Code experience to PondPilot.
- **Persistent Database**: Soon, PondPilot will persist the managed internal DuckDB database across reloads, so you'll be able to maintain not just scripts and sources, but also temporary tables and other DuckDB objects.
- **New Export Formats**: More export formats are coming, including JSON, Parquet, and DuckDB.
- **New (Remote) Data Sources**: Multiple new data sources are coming, including remote DuckDB databases.
