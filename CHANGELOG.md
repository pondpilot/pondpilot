## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-05

### ‚ú® Highlights

Today's release brings a lot of big & shiny new features, including two of the most requested ones:

- **AI Assistant**: You can now ask PondPilot to write and fix SQL queries for you! Just add your API key in the settings, and you'll be able to use OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other LLM provider that supports the OpenAI API.
- **Persistent Database**: Now you can create temporary tables, views, and other DuckDB objects that will persist across reloads.

But that's not all! We've also added support for more export formats, added schema browser, enabled file drag and drop, and upgraded DuckDB which unlocked the ability to attach remote DuckDB databases!

We hope you'll enjoy these new features! As always, we are looking forward to your feedback and suggestions.

### üéØ What's Next

We are already working on the next version, including:

- Improved, unified data source explorer
- AI Assistant improvements
- New data source types

and more!

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-13

A quick reminder: PondPilot is continuously updated at [app.pondpilot.io](https://app.pondpilot.io), but we occasionally mark major milestones so you can easily discover new features and improvements.

### ‚ú® Highlights

There have been many improvements since 0.1.0, including a complete rework of how we handle data sources, allowing us to open multi-gigabyte files in milliseconds. Here are some highlights:

- **Improved Performance**: PondPilot is now nearly as fast as the native DuckDB CLI and can open multi-gigabyte files instantly.
- **Script Sharing**: You can now share your scripts with others via a simple URL, making it easy to collaborate with your team or share your work with the community.
- **Automatic Data Refresh on External Changes**: If a local file source is changed outside of PondPilot, the app will now behave like a true desktop application and transparently pick up the changes. _Note: There are still some limitations with this feature, but we are working on it._
- **Folder Support**: You can now add entire folders to PondPilot, and it will automatically include all the files inside.
- **Full Support for Multi-Tab State**: The app now feels like a true IDE, with tabs remembering their state between reloads and when switching.
- **Query Editor Improvements**: The query editor now provides better auto-completion suggestions, including automatic quoting. Finally, you can safely and easily work with your favorite file called `my ü¶Ü.csv`!

### üéØ What's Next

We are working on a new version. Here are some features you can expect:

- **Query Editor Improvements**: We know the current query editor is far from perfect; we are working on bringing a full VS Code experience to PondPilot.
- **Persistent Database**: Soon, PondPilot will persist the managed internal DuckDB database across reloads, so you'll be able to maintain not just scripts and sources, but also temporary tables and other DuckDB objects.
- **New Export Formats**: More export formats are coming, including JSON, Parquet, and DuckDB.
- **New (Remote) Data Sources**: Multiple new data sources are coming, including remote DuckDB databases.
