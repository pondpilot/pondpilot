# AI Chat Controller Migration Notes

## Current Architecture

The AI Chat feature currently uses a class-based controller (`AIChatController`) with:
- Observer pattern for component subscriptions
- Built-in broadcast sync for multi-tab communication
- Separate persistence layer via IndexedDB
- Clean separation of concerns

## Zustand Migration Consideration

### Benefits of Migration
1. **Consistency**: Aligns with app-wide state management
2. **React Integration**: Built-in hooks with optimization
3. **DevTools**: Redux DevTools support for debugging
4. **Unified Persistence**: Can leverage existing IndexedDB infrastructure

### Drawbacks
1. **Refactoring Risk**: Large changes across many components
2. **Working System**: Current implementation is stable and tested
3. **Broadcast Complexity**: Would need reimplementation
4. **Time Investment**: Significant effort for marginal gains

## Decision (July 2025)

**Keep the current AIChatController implementation** for now. Reasons:

1. The current system is working well with no reported issues
2. Multi-tab sync via BroadcastChannel is already implemented
3. The risk of introducing bugs outweighs the benefits
4. Development time is better spent on new features

## Future Migration Path

If migration becomes necessary:

1. Create `ai-chat-slice.ts` in the store directory
2. Add chat conversations to AppStore type and initialState
3. Implement broadcast sync as zustand middleware
4. Update all components to use zustand hooks
5. Add persistence logic to save/restore with other app state
6. Thoroughly test multi-tab scenarios
7. Remove the old controller and broadcast sync

## Implementation Notes

A draft implementation of the zustand slice has been created at:
`/src/store/ai-chat-slice.ts`

This can serve as a starting point for future migration efforts.
