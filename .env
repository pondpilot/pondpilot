# Optional Google Sheets extension loading.
# Community loading requires compatible WASM builds from DuckDB community extensions.
# Set to true to try: INSTALL gsheets FROM community; LOAD gsheets;
# VITE_DUCKDB_ENABLE_GSHEETS_EXTENSION=true

# Optional direct gsheets WASM extension URL (takes precedence over community loading).
# Typically used for custom/self-hosted gsheets builds that match the app's DuckDB-WASM version.
# You can copy a locally built artifact with:
# GSHEETS_WASM_SOURCE=/path/to/gsheets.duckdb_extension.wasm yarn gsheets:install
# VITE_GSHEETS_EXTENSION_URL=/duckdb-extensions/gsheets/gsheets.duckdb_extension.wasm

# Google Sheets access tokens are managed at runtime through the connection
# wizard and the encrypted secret store — not via environment variables.
# VITE_* vars are embedded in the client bundle and would expose credentials.
