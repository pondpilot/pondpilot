üöÄ Introducing PondPilot - Get your data ü¶Ü in a row!

We built the data exploration tool we wished existed:
‚úÖ 100% browser-based
‚úÖ Your data NEVER leaves your device
‚úÖ Powered by DuckDB's blazing-fast engine
‚úÖ AI-assisted SQL (with YOUR keys)

Here's why it matters üßµ

Your data is sensitive. Yet most analysis tools upload it to the cloud.

PondPilot is different:
- Runs entirely in YOUR browser
- Zero server communication
- Direct file access (no copying)
- Your API keys, your control

Here's how we built true data privacy üßµ
```

### 3. Performance Thread

We analyzed 1 billion rows in the browser. In seconds.

No servers. No cloud. Just DuckDB-WASM and smart engineering.

Here's how PondPilot achieves desktop-level performance in your browser üßµ
```

### 4. Tutorial Threads
```
SQL tip: Analyzing CSV files shouldn't require database setup.

With PondPilot:

2. Write SQL immediately
3. No installation needed

Let me show you a real example üßµ
